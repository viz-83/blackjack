## The deck is unlimited in size. 
## There are no jokers. 
## The Jack/Queen/King all count as 10.
## The the Ace can count as 11 or 1.
## Use the following list as the deck of cards:
## cards = [11, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 10, 10, 10]
## The cards in the list have equal probability of being drawn.
## Cards are not removed from the deck as they are drawn.
## The computer is the dealer.

#Then try to create your own flowchart for the program.

#Hint 3: Download and read this flow chart I've created: 
#   https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1rDkiHCrhaf9eX7u7yjM1qwSuyEk-rPnt

#Hint 4: Create a deal_card() function that uses the List below to *return* a random card.
#11 is the Ace.
#cards = [11, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 10, 10, 10]
import random

  cards = [11, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 10, 10, 10]
  card=random.choice(cards)
  return card

def calculate_score(cards):
  if sum(cards)==21 and len(cards)==2:
    return 0

  return sum(cards)
  if sum(cards)>21 and 11 in cards:
    cards.remove(11)
    cards.append(1)

def compare(user_score,comp_score):
  if user_score==compare:
    return "Its a draw"
  elif comp_score==0:
    return "You lose, oppenent has a blackjack"
  elif user_score==0:
    return "You win with a blackjack"

#Hint 5: Deal the user and computer 2 cards each using deal_card() and append().
